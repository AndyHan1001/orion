S3 Provider for Orion Filesystem
================================

Depends on [lepozepo:s3](https://github.com/Lepozepo/S3)

Orion is a simple and useful cms for meteor. 
Creates automatically a admin panel for 
your collections and gives you the ability 
to have key/value definitions for your site.

More info on http://orion.meteor.com

## Installation

Install the package
```
meteor add orionjs:s3
```

Navigate to admin > config > aws and 
define your Amazon S3 credentials.

### Create your Amazon S3
For all of this to work you need to create an aws account. On their website create navigate to S3 and create a bucket. Navigate to your bucket and on the top right side you'll see your account name. Click it and go to Security Credentials. Once you're in Security Credentials create a new access key under the Access Keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) tab. This is the info you will use for the first step of this plug. Go back to your bucket and select the properties OF THE BUCKET, not a file. Under Static Website Hosting you can Enable website hosting, to do that first upload a blank index.html file and then enable it. YOU'RE NOT DONE.

You need to set permissions so that everyone can see what's in there. Under the Permissions tab click Edit CORS Configuration and paste this:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

Save it. Now click Edit bucket policy and paste this, REPLACE THE BUCKET NAME WITH YOUR OWN:

``` javascript
{
	"Version": "2008-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Principal": {
				"AWS": "*"
			},
			"Action": "s3:GetObject",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAMEHERE/*"
		}
	]
}
```
